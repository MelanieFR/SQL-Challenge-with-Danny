# üçú üçõ üç£ Case Study 2: Pizza Runner üçú üçõ üç£


## Introduction


Did you know that over 115 million kilograms of pizza is consumed daily worldwide??? (Well according to Wikipedia anyway‚Ä¶)

Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - ‚Äú80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!‚Äù

Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting ‚Äúrunners‚Äù to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny‚Äôs house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.


## Problem Statement:

Because Danny had a few years of experience as a data scientist - he was very aware that data collection was going to be critical for his business‚Äô growth.

He has prepared for us an entity relationship diagram of his database design but requires further assistance to clean his data and apply some basic calculations so he can better direct his runners and optimise Pizza Runner‚Äôs operations.

## Datasets used:



 * runners:  table shows the registration_date for each new runner
 * customer_orders: Show the customer pizza orders with 1 row for each individual pizza that is part of the order.
 * runner_orders: After each orders are received through the system - they are assigned to a runner - however not all orders are fully completed and can be cancelled by the restaurant or the customer.

The pickup_time is the timestamp at which the runner arrives at the Pizza Runner headquarters to pick up the freshly cooked pizzas. The distance and duration fields are related to how far and long the runner had to travel to deliver the order to the respective customer.
 * pizza_names: At the moment - Pizza Runner only has 2 pizzas available the Meat Lovers or Vegetarian!
 * pizza_recipes: Each pizza_id has a standard set of toppings which are used as part of the pizza recipe.
 * pizza_toppings: This table contains all of the topping_name values with their corresponding topping_id value


## Case Study Questions:
This case study has LOTS of questions - they are broken up by area of focus
Before you start writing your SQL queries however - you might want to investigate the data, you may want to do something with some of those null values and data types in the customer_orders and runner_orders tables!

### A. Pizza Metrics
1. How many pizzas were ordered?
2. How many unique customer orders were made?
3. How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?
4. How many of each type of pizza was delivered?
5. How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?
6. What was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order?
7. For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?
8. How many pizzas were delivered that had both exclusions and extras?
9. What was the total volume of pizzas ordered for each hour of the day?
10. What was the volume of orders for each day of the week?
